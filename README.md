# ü©∫ HealthPredict-AI: Pneumonia Detection from Chest X-rays

This project is a web application that uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. The application provides a simple interface to upload an X-ray, and the deep learning model returns a prediction indicating whether the patient has pneumonia or is normal.

The core model was trained based on the methodology outlined in this [Kaggle Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/madz2000/pneumonia-detection-using-cnn-92-6-accuracy/input).

## üöÄ Features

* **User-Friendly Interface**: A clean and simple web page to upload chest X-ray images.
* **Real-Time Predictions**: The CNN model provides a fast prediction after an image is uploaded.
* **High Accuracy**: The underlying model is trained to achieve **92.6% accuracy** on the test dataset.
* **Scalable Backend**: Built with a lightweight Flask backend, making it easy to deploy.

## üìä Model & Performance

The heart of this application is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras.

* **Architecture**: The model consists of multiple `Conv2D` and `MaxPooling2D` layers, followed by `Dropout` for regularization and `Dense` layers for classification.
* **Training**: The model was trained on the **Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)** dataset from Kaggle. **Data augmentation** techniques (rotation, zoom, shear) were used via `ImageDataGenerator` to prevent overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize.
* **Performance**: The model achieved **92.6% accuracy** on the validation set. The confusion matrix below shows its performance in distinguishing between the 'Pneumonia' and 'Normal' classes.
